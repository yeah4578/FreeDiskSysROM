; If A < $20, it fills pattern table data with the value in X for 16 * Y tiles,
; or Y * 256 bytes.
; If A >= $20, it fills the corresponding nametable with the value in X and
; attribute table with the value in Y.
; Parameters: A = High VRAM Address (aka tile row #), X = Fill value, Y = # of tile rows OR attribute fill data
; Affects: A, $00, $01, $02, $FF (aka PPUCTRL)
