LoadFiles:

; Appends the file data given by DiskID to the disk. This means that the file
; is tacked onto the end of the disk, and the disk file count is incremented.

; VRAM Buffers
;  The structure of VRAM buffers are as follows:
;
; SIZE   CONTENTS
; 2      VRAM Address (big endian)
; 1      bit 0-5 length of data ($0 means a length of 64)
;        bit 6 : 0 = copy, 1 = fill
;        bit 7 : 0 = increment by 1, 1 = increment by 32
; n      Data to copy to VRAM
; .....  repeated as many times as needed
; 1      $ff
;
; * The main structure is terminated by a byte >= $80 (High address is always
;   supposed to be in $00..$3f range)
; * $4c is a "call" command. The 2 bytes that follow is the address of a sub-
;   VRAM structure. The sub-structure can call another sub-structure and so on.
; * $60 is a "return" command. It will terminate a sub-structure.
; * If Fill mode is used, the routine takes only 1 byte of data which is
;   repeated.
;
; The VRAM buffer is located at $300-$3xx. $300 holds the size of the buffer
; (maximum), and $301 holds the end index of the buffer. The actual buffer lies
; at $302-$3xx, and is of variable length.
;
; * $300 is initialized to the value $7d, effectively making the buffer lie at
;   $300-$37f. It's possible to change the value here to make it bigger or
;   smaller, but the biggest possible value is $fd, making the buffer lie at
;   $300-$3ff.
; * Format of the buffer is equivalent to the VRAM structure above, except that
;   there are no sub-structures, no increment by 32 flag and no fill flag.
; * For this reason, the VRAM buffer at $302 can be used as a sub-structure.
; * A call to WriteVRAMBuffers will execute faster than a call to
;   VRAMStructWrite with $302 as an argument, but both will have the same
;   effect.
;
; The structure of the VRAM read buffer itself is trivial - only single bytes
; are read (there's no runs of data). All reads are mapped to a structure of 3
; bytes in the read buffer:
;
; SIZE   CONTENTS
; 2      VRAM Address (big endian)
; 1      data
;
; Therfore, for each byte which is read from VRAM, 3 bytes have to be reserved
; in the read buffer. Once data from VRAM has been read, if it must be written
; back after a modification, the user need to copy it to the write buffer
; manually.
